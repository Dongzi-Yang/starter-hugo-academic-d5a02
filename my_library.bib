  address   = {Beijing, China},
  pages     = {8},
  abstract  = {Bulk handling of powders and granular solids is common in many industries and often gives rise to handling difficulties especially when the material exhibits complex cohesive behavior. For example, high storage stresses in a silo can lead to high cohesive strength of the stored solid, which may in turn cause blockages such as ratholing or arching near the outlet during discharge. The wall friction and the internal friction of the stored solid are expected to influence the flow pattern which develops within a silo. The varying flow pattern and the possibility of cohesive arching in the solid can lead to significant variation in the wall pressures observed in a silo during discharge.

  This paper deploys the Discrete Element Method to study the discharge of a granular solid from a flat-bottomed silo with varying levels of cohesion and varying levels of internal friction which arises from a combination of particle interlocking and contact friction (sliding and rolling). The DEM simulations were conducted using the commercial EDEM code with a recently developed DEM contact model for cohesive solids implemented through an API. The contact model is based on an elasto-plastic contact with adhesion and uses hysteretic non-linear loading and unloading paths to model the elastic-plastic contact deformation. The adhesion parameter is a function of the plastic contact overlap. The model has previously been shown to be able to predict the stress history dependent behavior depicted by a flow function of the material.
  
  The effects of cohesion and friction on the discharge rate and flow pattern in the silo are investigated. The predicted discharge rates are compared for the varying levels of cohesion and the effect of adhesion is evaluated. The effect of varying wall friction on the flow patterns observed and the resulting wall pressure profiles is evaluated. Small levels of asymmetry in the flow channel can lead to large variations in silo wall pressures and the effect of varying friction on the flow channel is studied. The ability of the contact model to qualitatively predict the phenomena that are present in the discharge of a silo has also been shown with the salient features of mixed flow from a flat bottomed hopper identified in the simulation.},

  abstract = {Bonded contact models have been increasingly used in the discrete element method (DEM) to study cemented and sintered particulate materials in recent years. Several popular DEM bond models have been proposed in the literature; thus it is beneficial to assess the similarities and differences between the different bond models before they are used in simulations. This paper identifies and discusses two fundamental types of bond models: the Spring Bond Model where two bonded particles are joined by a set of uniform elastic springs on the bond's cross-section, and the Beam Bond Model in which a beam is used to connect the centres of two particles. A series of cantilever beam bending simulation cases were carried out to verify the findings and assess the strength and weakness of the bond models. Despite the numerous bond models described in the literature, they can all be considered as a variation of these two fundamental model types. The comparative evaluation in this paper also shows that all the bond models investigated can be unified to a general form given at a predefined contact point location.},

Prior to granulation experiments, sensitivity analysis of PBM parameters is performed to investigate the variation of model outputs given the input parameter variance. The significance of liquid to solid ratio (L/S ratio), nucleation and breakage parameters is identified by sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis dramatically reduces the number of fitting parameters in PBM and only nine granulation experiments are required for model calibration and validation. A model validation flowchart is proposed to elucidate the evolution of kinetic rate parameters associated with L/S ratio and screw element geometry. The presented MDD framework for sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, model verification and validation can be generalized and applied for any particulate process.},

Laboratory research aimed at characterising the electromagnetic properties has enabled researchers worldwide to determine ballast thickness using impulse ground penetrating radar (GPR) - based upon derived values of the relative electrical permittivity or dielectric constant. In this paper, a series of GPR experiments, following on from these laboratory experiments, were undertaken on a full scale track bed using a range of bowtie antennas from 500 MHz to 2.6 GHz. The key innovation reported is the use of scatter analyses of the GPR waveforms, featuring area, axis crossing and inflexion point analyses. These scatter analyses were then used to predict the Ionescu ballast fouling index. A correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 was obtained by using a 500 MHz bowtie antenna in the parallel orientation in conjunction with a scan area analysis.},

  volume    = {1},
  abstract  = {The coefficient of earth pressure at rest K0 is often used to determine the stress state of a soil in the design of retaining walls, excavations and foundations. The most commonly used equation was proposed originally by Jaky (1944) which expresses the ratio of horizontal to vertical stress in a normally consolidated soil as K0 = 1 - sin $\phi$, where $\phi$ is the effective angle of internal friction of the soil. This raises the question as to why the at rest stress state in a soil, which is not at failure, should be governed by the failure friction angle of the soil. The expression is often reported as empirical in nature however, Jaky arrived at the expression from an analytical approach. This paper explores the micromechanics of cohesionless soils by investigating the effect of soil fabric and the evolution of the lateral pressure under confined compression using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Many DEM models use spherical particles due to their greater efficiency. However, particle sphericity leads to the over-prediction of the lateral pressure ratio for a typical granular soil during a confined K 0 compression test. The lack of particle interlocking that is associated with spherical particles leads to a greater transmission of forces laterally in an assembly under confined compression, resulting in a higher K0 value.},

It's more and more popular to use the discrete element method (DEM) to study cemented granular materials (e.g. rocks and concrete). This paper verified the Timoshenko beam bond model (TBBM) presented by the University of Edinburgh, then compared the bending and dynamic response of a simply supported beam under the effects of moving load with the analytical prediction. It's ideally suited to use DEM to model the railroad ballast layer considering the naturally discrete inhomogeneous structure. A simplified railway embankment model composed of equal-sized ballast particles was built and the loading response of the simplified embankment was then investigated. The results show the feasibility of modeling train-induced dynamic load through adding moving load to railway track made up with the bonded particles. This paper presents one way to take the discrete features of the ballast layer and the characteristics of railway track into consideration in the same DEM framework at the same time. Apart from that, the mechanical characteristics of the ballast layer and the interactions between the ballast and railway track can be easily studied.},

VELaSSCo (Visualization for Extremely Large-Scale Scientific Computing) is a platform developed to provide new visual analysis methods for large-scale simulations serving the petabyte era. The platform adopts Big Data tools/architectures to enable in-situ processing for analytics of engineering and scientific data and hardware-accelerated interactive visualization. In large-scale simulations, the domain is partitioned across several thousand nodes, and the data (mesh and results) are stored on those nodes in a distributed manner. The VELaSSCo platform accesses this distributed information, processes the raw data, and returns the results to the users for local visualization by their specific visualization clients and tools. The global goal of VELaSSCo is to provide Big Data tools for the engineering and scientific community, in order to better manipulate simulations with billions of distributed records. The ability to easily handle large amounts of data will also enable larger, higher resolution simulations, which will allow the scientific and engineering communities to garner new knowledge from simulations previously considered too large to handle. This paper shows, by means of selected Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation use cases, that the VELaSSCo platform facilitates distributed post-processing and visualization of large engineering datasets.},

  abstract  = {Bulk handling of powders and granular solids is common in many industries and often gives rise to handling difficulties especially when the material exhibits complex cohesive behavior. In this study the effect of moisture on the level of cohesion, and thus handleability, of iron ore fines is investigated. The compression and flow function of the iron ore fines was established form a semi-automated uniaxial tester – the Edinburgh Powder Tester (EPT). The confined compression behavior of the material in terms of stress, strain and density can be measured as well as the unconfined shear behavior. The cohesive strength is determined from unconfined compressions tests following confined consolidation to a range of consolidation stresses.

Discrete Element Method simulations of the experiment were carried out using a recently developed DEM contact model for cohesive solids, an Elasto-Plastic Adhesive model. This particle contact model uses hysteretic non-linear loading and unloading paths and an adhesion parameter which is a function of the maximum contact overlap. The model parameters for the simulations are phenomenologically based to reproduce the key bulk characteristics exhibited by the solid (Morrissey 2013; Morrissey et al. 2013). 

The experimental data from the EPT provides a comprehensive set of results for the material behavior. As well as the shear strength, the detailed stress-strain behavior of the material for both confined and unconfined compression is measured. The DEM predictions were compared with the experimental observations and an excellent agreement was found between the DEM simulated flow functions and the experimentally observed flow functions of the cohesive iron ore fines. The strong correlation between the DEM and experimental results demonstrates the potential of DEM simulations to be used in assessing bulk handling situations.},

  abstract = {The aim of the project was to investigate cementitious binders of various materials 
including ggbs and gypsum. This included the environmental impact of its use and 
production, economic benefit from alternatives, and most importantly the technical 
behaviour of concrete. 

Research has shown that greenhouse gas emissions from the cement industry accounts for 
approximately 7% of all carbon dioxide emissions globally. The majority of these 
emissions originate from the calcination of limestone in OPC production. The global 
cement industry is not considered a large producer of NOx, sulphur, and dust pollution. 
NOx emissions are largely from the burning of fossil fuels, not the cement industry and 
Sulphur emissions from the cement industry also has little effect at a global level, as almost 
100%  of emissions comes from fossil fuel combustion. 

The consequences of large proportions of gypsum in concrete can be severe, in some cases 
leading to sulphate attack. In any of its forms sulfate attack leads to the degradation of the 
cement, causing the concrete to loose its strength. In the form of thaumasite sulfate attack, 
it turns concrete to a mushy paste-like mass which, can be crushed in ones hands.  

A solution investigated in the experimentation for the project was the replacement of OPC 
with gypsum. Performing this had the effect of mirroring the reactions of sulfate attack 
with gypsum. 

The use of ground granulated blast furnace slag was also investigated in experiments. Ggbs 
was used as it is known to reduce sulfate attack through. It also has a much more 
environmentally friendly production, producing less than one tenth the CO2 emissions of 
OPC production.  

Samples were tested to investigate whether they are viable alternatives for the construction 
industry. Experiments in to their required setting time, flexural strength and compressive 
strength were carried out. Comparisons in terms of their performance in both strength and 
setting were made to evaluate the potential applications of each formulation used. 

The results of these experiments and have been outlined and the recommendations for use 
given in the concluding chapters of the report.},

  abstract = {An adhesive elasto-plastic contact model for the discrete element method with three dimensional non-spherical particles is proposed and investigated to achieve quantitative prediction of cohesive powder flowability. Simulations have been performed for uniaxial consolidation followed by unconfined compression to failure using this model. The model has been shown to be capable of predicting the experimental flow function (unconfined compressive strength vs. the prior consolidation stress) for a limestone powder which has been selected as a reference solid in the Europe wide PARDEM research network. Contact plasticity in the model is shown to affect the flowability significantly and is thus essential for producing satisfactory computations of the behaviour of a cohesive granular material. The model predicts a linear relationship between a normalized unconfined compressive strength and the product of coordination number and solid fraction. This linear relationship is in line with the Rumpf model for the tensile strength of particulate agglomerate. Even when the contact adhesion is forced to remain constant, the increasing unconfined strength arising from stress consolidation is still predicted, which has its origin in the contact plasticity leading to microstructural evolution of the coordination number. The filled porosity is predicted to increase as the contact adhesion increases. Under confined compression, the porosity reduces more gradually for the load-dependent adhesion compared to constant adhesion. It was found that the contribution of adhesive force to the limiting friction has a significant effect on the bulk unconfined strength. The results provide new insights and propose a micromechanical based measure for characterising the strength and flowability of cohesive granular materials.},

  abstract  = {Discrete element modelling of a monotonic triaxial test is carried out with the aim of studying the stress-
strain response of railway ballast in a large-scale tester. The latex membrane of the tester is modelled 
via a lattice of bonded particles to investigate the effects of membrane stiffness on the stress-strain 
response. The confining pressure application through the membrane is achieved via individual forces 
applied to the membrane particles, giving rise  to a uniform, radially  inward, equivalent stress. This 
modelling approach leads to a close agreement with published experimental data. A coarse-graining 
analysis of the numerical results is performed to study the evolution of the stress state in the numerical 
sample.},

The DEM simulations were conducted using the commercial code EDEM. Wet granulation is a process used to create larger stable agglomerates (granules) from fine powders. It is commonly employed in the food, pharmaceutical, detergent, and fertilizer industries. It has many desirable benefits such as improving flowability, compactibility, and homogeneity. Wet granulation is the most common type of granulation. In pharmaceutical applications, it is a critical step in tablet manufacturing that affects the uniformity and compactibility of the final dosage form. Despite wide adoption it is often inefficiently operated, with high recycle ratios in continuous processes and high rejection rates in batch processes. A full 3D CAD model of the TSG was constructed from detailed measurements of both individual elements (Conveying, Kneading & Chopping) and the granulator, allowing the numerous configurations to be easily assembled and imported into the DEM simulations.},

A series of GPR experiments were undertaken on the trackbed using a range of bowtie antennas from 500MHz to 2.6GHz. Scatter analyses of the GPR waveforms included area analyses, axis crossing analyses and inflexion point analyses. When predicting Fouling Index, a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 was obtained by using a 500 MHz bowtie antenna in the parallel orientation in conjunction with a scan area analysis. This paper will outline the recent work of other researchers and the detailed experimental program at the University of Edinburgh.},

  month    = dec,
  abstract = {With increasing train speed and wheel axle load, severe vibrations can occur in a ballasted trackbed, thereby accelerating the degradation of the ballast particles and ultimately causing excessive settlement. To gain insights into the long-term trackbed behavior and the ballast degradation evolution, a full-scale ballasted track experiment with eight sleepers was designed and tested on a validated physical model test platform (ZJU-iHSRT). Sieving analysis together with computer-aided ballast morphology analysis were adopted to quantify the ballast degradation in terms of both the ballast particle size and morphological evolution, after every 100,000 train carriages. Various sensors were installed at key locations in the trackbed to record the dynamic stress responses, vibration velocities and deformations under train moving loads for up to 500,000 train carriages in total. The movements of individual particles inside the ballast layer were also captured using “SmartRock” wireless sensors. The dynamic soil stresses and vibration velocities in the trackbed all peaked at the locations underneath the rail seat and decayed with the distance away from the rail seat. Severe ballast degradation occurred in both particle sizes and morphological properties, with the ballast particles in the middle zone under the sleeper suffering a greater degradation due to the stronger compression effect. The long-term train loads densified the ballast layer, both through particle rearrangement and particle breakage filling the voids in the ballast bed, allowing the stresses and vibrations to be better dissipated. The amplitudes of the vertical stresses and the vibration velocities in the trackbed around the rail seat were reduced by over 25% and 38% respectively after 500,000 train loading carriages. The ballast particle shape became more compact after the test, with larger diameter and more Platy, Bladed and Elongated shapes found to be the more likely to degrade. Over 50% of the permanent settlement of the ballasted trackbed resulted from the ballast layer deformation, and the increase in the train speed intensified particle movements away from the sleeper in the lateral and longitudinal directions in the ballast layer and accelerated the development of the accumulated settlement, while the increase in the axle load caused the ballast breakage index (BBI) to rise dramatically by over 50% and contributed significantly to a greater settlement.},

  abstract       = {Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations have the potential to provide particle-scale understanding of twin-screw granulators. This is difficult to obtain experimentally because of the closed, tightly confined geometry. An essential prerequisite for successful DEM modelling of a twin-screw granulator is making the simulations tractable, i.e., reducing the significant computational cost while retaining the key physics. Four methods are evaluated in this paper to achieve this goal: (i) develop reduced-scale periodic simulations to reduce the number of particles; (ii) further reduce this number by scaling particle sizes appropriately; (iii) adopt an adhesive, elasto-plastic contact model to capture the effect of the liquid binder rather than fluid coupling; (iv) identify the subset of model parameters that are influential for calibration. All DEM simulations considered a GEA ConsiGma&trade; 1 twin-screw granulator with a 60&deg; rearward configuration for kneading elements. Periodic simulations yielded similar results to a full-scale simulation at significantly reduced computational cost. If the level of cohesion in the contact model is calibrated using laboratory testing, valid results can be obtained without fluid coupling. Friction between granules and the internal surfaces of the granulator is a very influential parameter because the response of this system is dominated by interactions with the geometry.},

  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {Attrition and breakage of agglomerates are prevalent during production and handling processes in many industries. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to model and analyse the agglomerate breakage process under various loading conditions. The ensemble strength and breakage patterns of agglomerates are still not well understood despite a significant amount of research being carried out. In this study, three-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of the impact breakage behaviour of agglomerates were performed using a Timoshenko beam bond model which considers axial, shear, twisting and bending behaviours on the bonds. An advantage of the Timoshenko beam bond model is the pertinent parameters of the bond contact have clear physical meaning and therefore could be determined through corresponding experimental characterisations. The mechanical properties of the bonds in this study were firstly calibrated using experimental measurements. The validation of the Timoshenko beam bond model was then undertaken by direct comparisons between the numerical simulation and experimental results of impact tests. It was shown that the time evolution of the agglomerate breakage process obtained from simulation had excellent agreement with experimental observations. Numerical results indicate that most of the damages happen at the early stage of the impact and a cone shape fracture zone is formed quickly inside the agglomerate where strong compressive stresses are concentrated. It is found that the exterior of the fracture zone is surrounded by an arch shape tensile stress which dominates the fracture propagation.},
