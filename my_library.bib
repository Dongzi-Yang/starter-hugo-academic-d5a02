abstract = {In this paper, the loading behaviour of iron ore fines was investigated using both a confined compression test and a uniaxial test. This provides a comprehensive description of the material behaviour in terms of bulk compressibility, loading-unloading stiffness, unconfined strength and lateral pressure ratio. The effect of moisture content on the iron ore fines behaviour is evaluated and comparison is made between the different types of fines materials. DEM simulations of the uniaxial experiments are carried out and the predictions, using a new contact model for iron ore fines, are presented and compared with the experimental data. The results show the significant effect of additional moisture on the cohesive strength of the iron ore fines and the lateral pressure ratio has been evaluated to be 0.39. DEM simulation results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.},

  title    = {{An assessment and unification of bond models in DEM simulations}},
  year     = {2021},
  abstract = {Bonded contact models have been increasingly used in the discrete element method (DEM) to study cemented and sintered particulate materials in recent years. Several popular DEM bond models have been proposed in the literature; thus it is beneficial to assess the similarities and differences between the different bond models before they are used in simulations. This paper identifies and discusses two fundamental types of bond models: the Spring Bond Model where two bonded particles are joined by a set of uniform elastic springs on the bond's cross-section, and the Beam Bond Model in which a beam is used to connect the centres of two particles. A series of cantilever beam bending simulation cases were carried out to verify the findings and assess the strength and weakness of the bond models. Despite the numerous bond models described in the literature, they can all be considered as a variation of these two fundamental model types. The comparative evaluation in this paper also shows that all the bond models investigated can be unified to a general form given at a predefined contact point location.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a generic framework of Model Driven Design (MDD) with its application for a twin screw granulation process using a mechanistic-based population balance model (PBM). The process kernels including nucleation, breakage, layering and consolidation are defined in the PBM. A recently developed breakage kernel is used with key physics incorporated in the model formulation. Prior to granulation experiments, sensitivity analysis of PBM parameters is performed to investigate the variation of model outputs given the input parameter variance. The significance of liquid to solid ratio (L/S ratio), nucleation and breakage parameters is identified by sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis dramatically reduces the number of fitting parameters in PBM and only nine granulation experiments are required for model calibration and validation. A model validation flowchart is proposed to elucidate the evolution of kinetic rate parameters associated with L/S ratio and screw element geometry. The presented MDD framework for sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, model verification and validation can be generalized and applied for any particulate process.},

  abstract = {Abstract The overall aim of this project was to relate ground penetrating radar (GPR) to a ballast fouling index (FI). Laboratory research aimed at characterising the electromagnetic properties has enabled researchers worldwide to determine ballast thickness using impulse ground penetrating radar (GPR) - based upon derived values of the relative electrical permittivity or dielectric constant. In this paper, a series of GPR experiments, following on from these laboratory experiments, were undertaken on a full scale track bed using a range of bowtie antennas from 500 MHz to 2.6 GHz. The key innovation reported is the use of scatter analyses of the GPR waveforms, featuring area, axis crossing and inflexion point analyses. These scatter analyses were then used to predict the Ionescu ballast fouling index. A correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 was obtained by using a 500 MHz bowtie antenna in the parallel orientation in conjunction with a scan area analysis.},

@inproceedings{Khan2015,
abstract = {The coefficient of earth pressure at rest K0 is often used to determine the stress state of a soil in the design of retaining walls, excavations and foundations. The most commonly used equation was proposed originally by Jaky (1944) which expresses the ratio of horizontal to vertical stress in a normally consolidated soil as K0 = 1 - sin $\phi$, where $\phi$ is the effective angle of internal friction of the soil. This raises the question as to why the at rest stress state in a soil, which is not at failure, should be governed by the failure friction angle of the soil. The expression is often reported as empirical in nature however, Jaky arrived at the expression from an analytical approach. This paper explores the micromechanics of cohesionless soils by investigating the effect of soil fabric and the evolution of the lateral pressure under confined compression using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Many DEM models use spherical particles due to their greater efficiency. However, particle sphericity leads to the over-prediction of the lateral pressure ratio for a typical granular soil during a confined K 0 compression test. The lack of particle interlocking that is associated with spherical particles leads to a greater transmission of forces laterally in an assembly under confined compression, resulting in a higher K0 value. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

  abstract  = {With the rapid development of high-speed railway over the world in recent years, more and more researchers are focused on the strength, stiffness and stability of the embankment. It's more and more popular to use the discrete element method (DEM) to study cemented granular materials (e.g. rocks and concrete). This paper verified the Timoshenko beam bond model (TBBM) presented by the University of Edinburgh, then compared the bending and dynamic response of a simply supported beam under the effects of moving load with the analytical prediction. It's ideally suited to use DEM to model the railroad ballast layer considering the naturally discrete inhomogeneous structure. A simplified railway embankment model composed of equal-sized ballast particles was built and the loading response of the simplified embankment was then investigated. The results show the feasibility of modeling train-induced dynamic load through adding moving load to railway track made up with the bonded particles. This paper presents one way to take the discrete features of the ballast layer and the characteristics of railway track into consideration in the same DEM framework at the same time. Apart from that, the mechanical characteristics of the ballast layer and the interactions between the ballast and railway track can be easily studied.},

  abstract  = {Regardless of its origin, in the near future the challenge will not be how to generate data, but rather how to manage big and highly distributed data to make it more easily handled and more accessible by users on their personal devices. VELaSSCo (Visualization for Extremely Large-Scale Scientific Computing) is a platform developed to provide new visual analysis methods for large-scale simulations serving the petabyte era. The platform adopts Big Data tools/architectures to enable in-situ processing for analytics of engineering and scientific data and hardware-accelerated interactive visualization. In large-scale simulations, the domain is partitioned across several thousand nodes, and the data (mesh and results) are stored on those nodes in a distributed manner. The VELaSSCo platform accesses this distributed information, processes the raw data, and returns the results to the users for local visualization by their specific visualization clients and tools. The global goal of VELaSSCo is to provide Big Data tools for the engineering and scientific community, in order to better manipulate simulations with billions of distributed records. The ability to easily handle large amounts of data will also enable larger, higher resolution simulations, which will allow the scientific and engineering communities to garner new knowledge from simulations previously considered too large to handle. This paper shows, by means of selected Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation use cases, that the VELaSSCo platform facilitates distributed post-processing and visualization of large engineering datasets.},
