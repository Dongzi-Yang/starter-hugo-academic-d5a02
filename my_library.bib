This provides a comprehensive description of the material behaviour in terms of bulk compressibility, loading-unloading stiffness, unconfined strength and lateral pressure ratio. The effect of moisture content on the iron ore fines behaviour is evaluated and comparison is made between the different types of fines materials. DEM simulations of the uniaxial experiments are carried out and the predictions, using a new contact model for iron ore fines, are presented and compared with the experimental data. The results show the significant effect of additional moisture on the cohesive strength of the iron ore fines and the lateral pressure ratio has been evaluated to be 0.39. DEM simulation results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.},

  year     = {2021},
  abstract = {Bonded contact models have been increasingly used in the discrete element method (DEM) to study cemented and sintered particulate materials in recent years. Several popular DEM bond models have been proposed in the literature; thus it is beneficial to assess the similarities and differences between the different bond models before they are used in simulations. This paper identifies and discusses two fundamental types of bond models: the Spring Bond Model where two bonded particles are joined by a set of uniform elastic springs on the bond's cross-section, and the Beam Bond Model in which a beam is used to connect the centres of two particles. A series of cantilever beam bending simulation cases were carried out to verify the findings and assess the strength and weakness of the bond models. Despite the numerous bond models described in the literature, they can all be considered as a variation of these two fundamental model types. The comparative evaluation in this paper also shows that all the bond models investigated can be unified to a general form given at a predefined contact point location.},

The process kernels including nucleation, breakage, layering and consolidation are defined in the PBM. A recently developed breakage kernel is used with key physics incorporated in the model formulation. Prior to granulation experiments, sensitivity analysis of PBM parameters is performed to investigate the variation of model outputs given the input parameter variance. The significance of liquid to solid ratio (L/S ratio), nucleation and breakage parameters is identified by sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis dramatically reduces the number of fitting parameters in PBM and only nine granulation experiments are required for model calibration and validation. A model validation flowchart is proposed to elucidate the evolution of kinetic rate parameters associated with L/S ratio and screw element geometry. The presented MDD framework for sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, model verification and validation can be generalized and applied for any particulate process.},

Laboratory research aimed at characterising the electromagnetic properties has enabled researchers worldwide to determine ballast thickness using impulse ground penetrating radar (GPR) - based upon derived values of the relative electrical permittivity or dielectric constant. In this paper, a series of GPR experiments, following on from these laboratory experiments, were undertaken on a full scale track bed using a range of bowtie antennas from 500 MHz to 2.6 GHz. The key innovation reported is the use of scatter analyses of the GPR waveforms, featuring area, axis crossing and inflexion point analyses. These scatter analyses were then used to predict the Ionescu ballast fouling index. A correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 was obtained by using a 500 MHz bowtie antenna in the parallel orientation in conjunction with a scan area analysis.},

  volume    = {1},
  abstract  = {The coefficient of earth pressure at rest K0 is often used to determine the stress state of a soil in the design of retaining walls, excavations and foundations. The most commonly used equation was proposed originally by Jaky (1944) which expresses the ratio of horizontal to vertical stress in a normally consolidated soil as K0 = 1 - sin $\phi$, where $\phi$ is the effective angle of internal friction of the soil. This raises the question as to why the at rest stress state in a soil, which is not at failure, should be governed by the failure friction angle of the soil. The expression is often reported as empirical in nature however, Jaky arrived at the expression from an analytical approach. This paper explores the micromechanics of cohesionless soils by investigating the effect of soil fabric and the evolution of the lateral pressure under confined compression using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Many DEM models use spherical particles due to their greater efficiency. However, particle sphericity leads to the over-prediction of the lateral pressure ratio for a typical granular soil during a confined K 0 compression test. The lack of particle interlocking that is associated with spherical particles leads to a greater transmission of forces laterally in an assembly under confined compression, resulting in a higher K0 value.},

  abstract  = {With the rapid development of high-speed railway over the world in recent years, more and more researchers are focused on the strength, stiffness and stability of the embankment. It's more and more popular to use the discrete element method (DEM) to study cemented granular materials (e.g. rocks and concrete). This paper verified the Timoshenko beam bond model (TBBM) presented by the University of Edinburgh, then compared the bending and dynamic response of a simply supported beam under the effects of moving load with the analytical prediction. It's ideally suited to use DEM to model the railroad ballast layer considering the naturally discrete inhomogeneous structure. A simplified railway embankment model composed of equal-sized ballast particles was built and the loading response of the simplified embankment was then investigated. The results show the feasibility of modeling train-induced dynamic load through adding moving load to railway track made up with the bonded particles. This paper presents one way to take the discrete features of the ballast layer and the characteristics of railway track into consideration in the same DEM framework at the same time. Apart from that, the mechanical characteristics of the ballast layer and the interactions between the ballast and railway track can be easily studied.},

  abstract  = {Regardless of its origin, in the near future the challenge will not be how to generate data, but rather how to manage big and highly distributed data to make it more easily handled and more accessible by users on their personal devices. VELaSSCo (Visualization for Extremely Large-Scale Scientific Computing) is a platform developed to provide new visual analysis methods for large-scale simulations serving the petabyte era. The platform adopts Big Data tools/architectures to enable in-situ processing for analytics of engineering and scientific data and hardware-accelerated interactive visualization. In large-scale simulations, the domain is partitioned across several thousand nodes, and the data (mesh and results) are stored on those nodes in a distributed manner. The VELaSSCo platform accesses this distributed information, processes the raw data, and returns the results to the users for local visualization by their specific visualization clients and tools. The global goal of VELaSSCo is to provide Big Data tools for the engineering and scientific community, in order to better manipulate simulations with billions of distributed records. The ability to easily handle large amounts of data will also enable larger, higher resolution simulations, which will allow the scientific and engineering communities to garner new knowledge from simulations previously considered too large to handle. This paper shows, by means of selected Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation use cases, that the VELaSSCo platform facilitates distributed post-processing and visualization of large engineering datasets.},

  abstract = {The aim of the project was to investigate cementitious binders of various materials 
including ggbs and gypsum. This included the environmental impact of its use and 
production, economic benefit from alternatives, and most importantly the technical 
behaviour of concrete. 

Research has shown that greenhouse gas emissions from the cement industry accounts for 
approximately 7% of all carbon dioxide emissions globally. The majority of these 
emissions originate from the calcination of limestone in OPC production. The global 
cement industry is not considered a large producer of NOx, sulphur, and dust pollution. 
NOx emissions are largely from the burning of fossil fuels, not the cement industry and 
Sulphur emissions from the cement industry also has little effect at a global level, as almost 
100%  of emissions comes from fossil fuel combustion. 

The consequences of large proportions of gypsum in concrete can be severe, in some cases 
leading to sulphate attack. In any of its forms sulfate attack leads to the degradation of the 
cement, causing the concrete to loose its strength. In the form of thaumasite sulfate attack, 
it turns concrete to a mushy paste-like mass which, can be crushed in ones hands.  

A solution investigated in the experimentation for the project was the replacement of OPC 
with gypsum. Performing this had the effect of mirroring the reactions of sulfate attack 
with gypsum. 

The use of ground granulated blast furnace slag was also investigated in experiments. Ggbs 
was used as it is known to reduce sulfate attack through. It also has a much more 
environmentally friendly production, producing less than one tenth the CO2 emissions of 
OPC production.  

Samples were tested to investigate whether they are viable alternatives for the construction 
industry. Experiments in to their required setting time, flexural strength and compressive 
strength were carried out. Comparisons in terms of their performance in both strength and 
setting were made to evaluate the potential applications of each formulation used. 

The results of these experiments and have been outlined and the recommendations for use 
given in the concluding chapters of the report.},

  abstract = {An adhesive elasto-plastic contact model for the discrete element method with three dimensional non-spherical particles is proposed and investigated to achieve quantitative prediction of cohesive powder flowability. Simulations have been performed for uniaxial consolidation followed by unconfined compression to failure using this model. The model has been shown to be capable of predicting the experimental flow function (unconfined compressive strength vs. the prior consolidation stress) for a limestone powder which has been selected as a reference solid in the Europe wide PARDEM research network. Contact plasticity in the model is shown to affect the flowability significantly and is thus essential for producing satisfactory computations of the behaviour of a cohesive granular material. The model predicts a linear relationship between a normalized unconfined compressive strength and the product of coordination number and solid fraction. This linear relationship is in line with the Rumpf model for the tensile strength of particulate agglomerate. Even when the contact adhesion is forced to remain constant, the increasing unconfined strength arising from stress consolidation is still predicted, which has its origin in the contact plasticity leading to microstructural evolution of the coordination number. The filled porosity is predicted to increase as the contact adhesion increases. Under confined compression, the porosity reduces more gradually for the load-dependent adhesion compared to constant adhesion. It was found that the contribution of adhesive force to the limiting friction has a significant effect on the bulk unconfined strength. The results provide new insights and propose a micromechanical based measure for characterising the strength and flowability of cohesive granular materials.},

  abstract     = {This study employs the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to study a 25 mm diameter, GEA ConsiGma™ 1 Twin Screw Granulator (TSG), with a typical 60°configuration for kneading elements. The DEM simulations were conducted using the commercial code EDEM. Wet granulation is a process used to create larger stable agglomerates (granules) from fine powders. It is commonly employed in the food, pharmaceutical, detergent, and fertilizer industries. It has many desirable benefits such as improving flowability, compactibility, and homogeneity. Wet granulation is the most common type of granulation. In pharmaceutical applications, it is a critical step in tablet manufacturing that affects the uniformity and compactibility of the final dosage form. Despite wide adoption it is often inefficiently operated, with high recycle ratios in continuous processes and high rejection rates in batch processes. A full 3D CAD model of the TSG was constructed from detailed measurements of both individual elements (Conveying, Kneading & Chopping) and the granulator, allowing the numerous configurations to be easily assembled and imported into the DEM simulations.},

The materials can differ greatly in size, shape and type but are commonly affected by handling and storage difficulties, such as the blockage of silo outlets or transfer points, which occur as a result of the development of cohesion.

Adhesive forces between particles in a granular material are known to be dependent on the external forces previously exerted on the bulk solid. As a result, the previous stress states of a bulk solid need to be considered when evaluating the adhesive strength of a bulk material.},
