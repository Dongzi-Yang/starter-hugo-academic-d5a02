summary: Invited session at EDEM's "DEM Powder Calibration Meeting" to present the outcomes of the Models for Manufacturing of Particulate Products Project.

abstract: |-
  Powders are at the core of numerous applications in the pharmaceutical, additive manufacturing, chemicals and other process manufacturing industries. 
  
  The Discrete Element Method (DEM) has proven to be a great predictive tool for simulating processes in the powder handling industries and powder calibration is an important step towards realistic DEM simulations. However, it is also a genuine barrier for DEM applications. At EDEM we are keen to support our customers and bring together the experience and know-how on powder calibration techniques for various powder applications. 

  This first DEM Powder Calibration meeting will allow participants to discuss their key challenges and identify methods to address them. The focus of this meeting is on how to calibrate and develop appropriate DEM models for modelling powders. 

  Leading organizations and experts from industry and academia from around the world will be attending as well as special guests from leading powder testing equipment providers.
