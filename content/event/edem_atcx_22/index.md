  Oral Preentation at the ATCx DEM technology conference dedicated to the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for bulk and granular material simulation.

abstract: |-
  Particulate products are widely used in industry, but manufacturing processes such as granulation or milling remain poorly understood. This is primarily because of the complexity of a typical particulate system involving particle–particle and particle–fluid interaction phenomena. Modelling of such particulate systems has become increasingly popular as a powerful means to gain insight into the phenomena that govern the particulate processes. However, it remains a challenge to translate reality into an efficient computational model. 

  This presentation describes an academic–industrial partnership project to develop a generic framework for creating digital models and enable industry to implement efficient state-of-the-art models, taking twin screw granulation as an exemplar case study. A multi-scale modelling approach is adopted, using Discrete Element Method (DEM) to provide particle-scale physics and inform the process-scale using Population Balance Model (PBM).
