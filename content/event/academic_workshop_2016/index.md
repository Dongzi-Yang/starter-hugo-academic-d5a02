title: "Beyond Basic: Advanced simulations in EDEM using the Application Programming and Coupling Interfaces"

event: EDEM Academic workshop
event_url: https://www.ptf7.eng.ed.ac.uk/ 

location: Alexander Graham Bell Building, School of Engineering
address:
  street: Thomas Bayes rd., The King's Buildings

summary: An overview of the extensibility and capabilities provided through the EDEM API presented at the EDEM Academic Workshop.

abstract: "EDEM simulations can be customised and extended using the EDEM Application Programming Interface (API). THE API allows users to create custom contact model, particle body force models and particle factories. There are also various coupling options that allow CFD and rigid body dynamics to be included.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [*Slides*](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
