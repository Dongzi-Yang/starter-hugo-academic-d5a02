abstract: |-
  Wet granulation is an industrial process used to create larger stable agglomerates (granules) from fine powders. This has many desirable outcomes such as improving flowability, compactibility, and homogeneity. Granulation is commonly employed in the food, pharmaceutical, detergent, and fertilizer industries, but can suffer with high recycle ratios in continuous processes and high rejection rates in batch processes. 

  With twin screw granulation becoming a popularly employed method of wet granulation, an in-depth understanding of particle enlargement in the granulating process is necessary in order to improve the quality of the final product without the need for large-scale physical Design-of-Experiment studies.
