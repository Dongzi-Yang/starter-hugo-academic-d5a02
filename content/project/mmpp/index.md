The two-year Models for the **Manufacturing of Particulate Process (Models MPP)** project focused on establishing a generic framework and core capability to improve industrial productivity.

As part of the drive to provide more leverage and integration of the wealth of formulations expertise in the UK, the £700,000 project, funded by Innovate UK as part of CPI’s National Formulation Centre Strategic Projects Programme, has facilitated the translation of the UK’s world-leading expertise in computational modelling and simulation for the manufacturing of particulate processes. 

Connecting industry and university research groups with state-of-the-art technology has resulted in the development of a generic framework for translating particle models of industrial relevance into industrial practice. The developed framework incorporates a decision support methodology/​tool for models development that will allow easier access and adoption by leading UK-based industrial organisations. 

These models are expected to be deployed within industry to accelerate the development of innovative products and improve productivity and cost-effectiveness of product manufacturing processes.

This framework will provide guidance for the coupling of well-established computer modelling techniques at different size scales, to enable development scientists and engineers to develop models that simulate different parts of manufacturing processes from the dispensing of input materials through mixing, agglomeration and other subsequent processing steps.

Twin-screw wet granulation, a method used in a number of industry sectors, was used as an exemplar. Wet granulation is a process in which small primary particles are joined together using agitation and a liquid binder. The purpose is to improve the properties of very fine cohesive powders used in formulated products such as pharmaceuticals, ceramics, detergents and fertilizers.
Granulation is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry during tablet manufacturing. Fine powders are granulated to improve flow prior to tableting and reduce the potential for dusting and other production issues. The formation of granules also helps to reduce segregation and improve the content uniformity of the final product which is critical for consistent product performance.

The academic partners at the Universities of Edinburgh and Sheffield conducted a review of the current state of the art and used this insight to develop coupled models using EDEM and PSE software platforms and the technology vendor’s expertise in developing industrially robust models. These models were validated using real life trials at the industrial partner’s production facilities. 

While granulation is an important process in many industries, including pharmaceuticals, foods and agrochemicals, the framework provided by Models MPP means it can be broadly re-applied to other manufacturing operations and industries.

The legacy capability established from this project will be applied to other CPI strategic projects, e.g. in the development of a digital twin with a sister National Formulation Centre strategic project focused on a fully PAT enabled twin screw extruder (‘PROSPECT CP’).

CPI was part of a highly-effective consortium that worked on the project, with key industrial contributions from Astra Zeneca, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and Johnson Matthey, and SMEs including EDEM Simulations and Process Systems Enterprise (PSE).
