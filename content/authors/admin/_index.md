**Dongzi Yang** is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Integrated Circuit Science and Engineering at Fudan University. He received his B.E. degree in Materials Science and Engineering from Xidian University in 2020 and his M.E. degree in Materials and Chemical Engineering from Soochow University in 2023. His research interests include **neuromorphic devices and computing**, **flexible sensors**, and **intelligent sensing systems**.  

D.Y. was the developer of a novel sweat fingerprint identification method that captures the intrinsic ion dynamics of human sweat by organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) array and flexible sweat sensing system. 


Working the field of **neuromorphic computing**, *programming*, *data analysis* and *visualisation* are common tasks and *Origin*, *Python*, and *Matlab* are often the tools of choice.
