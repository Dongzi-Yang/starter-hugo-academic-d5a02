Lots of people have been complaining that **Wordle** has become much harder since the **NY Times** purchased the games and took control. 
But it is a random list of words so you would expect easy and hard words every so often. And while they have made some minor [changes](https://kotaku.com/wordle-archive-nyt-ban-offensive-guesses-streak-new-yor-1848525418) in the name of political correctness by removing possible *"offensive"* words, wholesale changes this quickly are unlikely.

Or so I thought.

While having a go at the daily puzzler over breakfast this morning I picked up my laptop which I rarely use to play the game as I was also checking some work stuff. 
As it turned out out I still had the page open from the last time I played and it was pointed at the  original URL - [powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/](powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) rather than the new NY Times address of [nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html](nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 

I started my game without much thought and struggled to make it in 6. Later while discussing today's word with my other half it soon became clear that we had solved different words!! What is going on?!

Anyway, here are the screenshots from a device where I had the old one still open in a chrome tab. 

<div class="row">
  <div class="column_2">
    {{< figure src="caerhays-3-1000x500.jpg" title="**Todays word from Original Site**" >}} 
  </div>
  <div class="column_2">
    {{< figure src="Caerhays-0406.jpg" title="**Todays word from NY Times**" >}}
  </div>
</div>

So it seems NY Times have already changed Wordle and the word list, and maybe they have added back in some of the 10,000 or so other possible 5 letter words that weren't on the original Wordle list, hence the feeling it is now more difficult as there are more obscure or less familiar words being used
