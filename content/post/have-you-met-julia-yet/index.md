There are many different programming languages out there such as `c`, `c++` and `Java`. These are probably considered more general computing languages.
Then there are some others that are higher level languages such as python. There are languages that have developed communities like `R` for data science. 
For years scientific computing was dominated by `Fortran` and `MATLAB`. There are many more examples but what they show is that there is rarely a language that does everything well.

For example, `python` is easy to learn and can do almost anything, but the trade of here is that it is an interpreted language and this makes it slow in comparison to `Java` and `C` which are compiled. 
However, it's ease of use has made it a star in recent years it the recent explosion in data science and AI has seen python's popularity soar.

If you have come from a scientific or academic background, then you will probably have spent many years using MATLAB as it was (and still is) a staple of many science and engineering undergraduate courses. 
And once you learn something you tend to keep using it because of familiarity: the devil you know is better than one don't!

I fall into this last category, I learned off MATLAB as an undergraduate but couldn't understand why we were being though something like this - who would ever need it. Roll on a few years into my Ph.D. and the first thing i did most days after switching on my computer was to open MATLAB in preparation for the days work. I enjoyed using MATLAB as it made my life easier for reading big data files and doing all my calculations. I couldn't have managed without it really. But I always had a desire to find something that didn't have a big price tag attached. 
Something similar and familiar feeling but free. 

I'd heard of this language called python that was like a cross between MATLAB and Perl and thought *"This sounds good"*, but I was nearing the end of my Ph.D. and the looming deadline meant I didn't have time to explore. 
Around the same time I also came across an [announcement](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/) of a new language that sounded like my ideal language. Like MATLAB to use but as fast as `C`. Perfect. 
But it was new, and still under developement. And my timedeadlines meant I soon forgot about it. Eventually I moved on to python and have been well served by it for many years now.

But I still long for more speed at times. Particluarly as my data sets grow with passing time (much like my waistline really).



## Meet Julia

Julia is still young. It's only been about 10 years since that early announcement that sounded so intriguing to me. 
I must admit that I forgot about it for many years as python did such a good job of filling all the holes. 

Recently I picked up an old computer and logged in looking for some old files and same this icon on the desktop for `Julia`. It was time to look it up and see how it was doing. Had the fullfilled their initial greedy ambitions? Was it even still active.

As it turns out, `Julia` is alive and well. Possibly even thriving as more people become aware of it'.
