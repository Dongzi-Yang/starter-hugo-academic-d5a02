When I decided to relaunch my website I decided to use a `Hugo` templating system called `Wowchemy`. It was simple, modular and flexible. 
It allowed me to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional website without having to spend huge amounts of time refreshing (re-learning!) `html` and `css` in my mind.

So I set up an inital site based on the demo content and started on the process of restoing conetn from my old website to this new one. It's been a few months since the start of my little adveture and I've gotten to know it a bit better. I've also become a bit more confident and started to change things from the default to how I want to see it. Some minor tweaks, some new features. I'm just goign to mention a few of these simple changes here to show how easy it really is to make it your own.
