  abstract  = {This paper presents the application of a digital twin in industrial manufacturing with an impact pin mill and  twin  screw  granulator  as  exemplar  studies.  A  new  particle  breakage  model  subject  to  impact 
loading pertaining to the impact pin mill was developed, which enables the contribution of the normal and tangential velocity components to be rationalised. In the twin screw granulation, a coupled model 
with DEM and PBM is proposed with a new breakage kernel developed for the TSG. The application of digital twin is hoped to facilitate the understanding of particulate process and help transit from digital 
design to digital operation.},
